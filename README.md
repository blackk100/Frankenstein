The background isn't included with the .rmskin package in releases, but here's a link to the original artwork: [Space Station by Morgan Prost](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/YaQwgP). The old background image was from [MKBHD's review of the iPhone 8](https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/914113772125609986).
